# Machine Learning Toolbox
This repository contains Python scripts used in Machine Learning that could be used for other projects. This repository is definetely not the best out there for use, some of the scripts might not be optimised rather intended to show working and proof of concept. This repository also contains Python scripts from Andrew Ng's Stanford CS229 assignments.
